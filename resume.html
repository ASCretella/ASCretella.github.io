    <h1>Andrew Cretella's R&eacute;sum&eacute;</h1><img src="Andrew.jpg" alt="Andrew Cretella">
<p>
    I am a future educator and perpetual student. As a life long learner, I hope to share my values and inspire students to continue their education through their entire life inside and outside of the classroom.
<p>
    I've been managing facilities at the University of Delaware since 1998. In 2007, I transfered to a higher education focused job, mentoring students through their extracurricular activities. My goal is to transfer what I've learned as a leader, planner, and mentor to a carrer in elementary education. I am looking forward to a new challenge in a meaningful field.
